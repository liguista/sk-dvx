2	00:04:12.976	00:04:15.311	YOU DO UNDERSTAND, MR. HAMILTON, ,
3	00:04:15.313	00:04:18.180	THAT AS PRESIDENT, I HAVE THE AUTHORITY
4	00:04:18.182	00:04:20.099	TO DECIDE ON JUNIOR OFFICERS.
5	00:04:23.754	00:04:26.589	WITHOUT QUESTION, SIR.
6	00:04:26.591	00:04:29.325	BUT GENERAL WASHINGTON...
7	00:04:29.327	00:04:31.628	WILL ONLY ACCEPT HIS CHARGE,
8	00:04:31.630	00:04:35.080	ON THE CONDITION THAT I SERVE AS HIS SECOND IN COMMAND.
9	00:04:37.334	00:04:39.368	NATURALLY, YOU MAY DECLINE
10	00:04:39.370	00:04:41.371	TO ACCEPT THE ARRANGEMENT.
11	00:04:46.844	00:04:49.112	OF COURSE NOT, MR. HAMILTON. OF COURSE NOT.
12	00:04:51.448	00:04:54.517	IT IS SOMEWHAT IRREGULAR,
13	00:04:54.519	00:04:56.986	BUT...
14	00:04:56.988	00:04:59.856	I WOULD NEVER COUNTERMAND HIS WISHES, SIR.
15	00:04:59.858	00:05:02.491	IF I MAY, SIR.
16	00:05:04.428	00:05:07.630	A COMPANY WILL BE SUBDIVIDED INTO TWO PLATOONS,
17	00:05:07.632	00:05:09.365	A PLATOON INTO TWO SECTIONS,
18	00:05:09.367	00:05:10.833	A SECTION INTO TWO SQUADS.
19	00:05:10.835	00:05:14.654	A SQUAD WILL CONSIST OF FOUR FILES OF THREE, OR TWO FILES OF
20	00:05:14.656	00:05:16.355	PERHAPS LATER, MR. HAMILTON.
21	00:05:16.357	00:05:18.490	WE ARE REMOVING OURSELVES TO PEACEFIELD,
22	00:05:18.492	00:05:21.644	TO AVOID THE YELLOW FEVER BEFORE IT STRIKES.
23	00:05:21.646	00:05:23.713	YOU MIGHT WANT TO LEAVE THE CITY YOURSELF, SIR.
24	00:05:23.715	00:05:26.749	FOR GENERAL WASHINGTON, I SUGGEST THIS:
25	00:05:28.185	00:05:31.203	A BLUE COAT WITHOUT LAPELS,
26	00:05:31.205	00:05:33.890	YELLOW BUTTONS AND DOUBLEBULLION TAG WITH FRINGE,
27	00:05:33.892	00:05:36.225	EACH WITH THREE STARS.
28	00:05:37.311	00:05:40.029	OBVIOUSLY, COLLAR CUFFS, ,
29	00:05:40.031	00:05:42.799	AND POCKET FLAPS WILL BE DOUBLEEMBROIDERED,
30	00:05:42.801	00:05:44.701	AS WILL THE BUTTONHOLES.
31	00:05:44.703	00:05:46.485	YES, BUT OF COURSE IT IS A MATTER
32	00:05:46.487	00:05:50.222	OF HOW THE ARMY IS TO BE USED, MR. HAMILTON, ,
33	00:05:50.224	00:05:51.641	IS IT NOT?,
34	00:05:53.627	00:05:55.762	TO WHAT END, YOU SEE.
35	00:05:57.364	00:05:59.298	ITS PRESENCE WILL BE...
36	00:05:59.300	00:06:00.800	PROVOCATIVE,
37	00:06:00.802	00:06:02.635	WHATEVER THE COLOR OF THE UNIFORMS.
38	00:06:05.405	00:06:08.307	IF WE'RE FORCED TO RELY ON INCOMPETENT STATE MILITIAS,
39	00:06:08.309	00:06:10.342	FOR OUR DEFENSE,
40	00:06:10.344	00:06:13.012	WE MAY AS WELL START LEARNING FRENCH NOW,
41	00:06:13.014	00:06:14.847	MR. PRESIDENT. ( chuckles ),
42	00:06:14.849	00:06:17.450	A NATIONAL ARMY BINDS THE COUNTRY,
43	00:06:17.452	00:06:19.702	MUCH AS A NATIONAL BANK DOES.
44	00:06:22.055	00:06:25.074	NOW, A TRAINING MANUAL...
45	00:06:25.076	00:06:26.709	IS ESSENTIAL.
46	00:06:26.711	00:06:29.212	HERE WE HAVE AN ILLUSTRATION,
47	00:06:29.214	00:06:31.214	FOR THE COMMAND HEAD RIGHT.
48	00:06:32.266	00:06:34.683	AT THE WORD RIGHT, THE SOLDIER 
49	00:06:34.685	00:06:36.852	TURNS HIS HEAD TO THE RIGHT BRISKLY 
50	00:06:36.854	00:06:38.754	BUT WITHOUT VIOLENCE, 
51	00:06:38.756	00:06:40.506	BRINGING HIS LEFT EYE IN LINE 
52	00:06:40.508	00:06:42.541	WITH THE BUTTONS OF HIS WAISTCOAT 
53	00:06:42.543	00:06:44.427	AND HIS RIGHT EYE LOOKING ALONG THE BREASTS 
54	00:06:44.429	00:06:46.095	OF THE SOLDIERS TO HIS RIGHT. 
55	00:06:49.299	00:06:51.967	( insects buzzing ) 
56	00:06:53.687	00:06:56.255	WHOA, BOY. WHOA. 
57	00:07:12.389	00:07:14.424	JOHN QUINCY IS ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN OF THIS? 
58	00:07:14.426	00:07:16.292	THE FRENCH ARE WILLING TO TALK PEACE? 
59	00:07:16.294	00:07:18.411	TALLEYRAND LET IT BE KNOWN THROUGH OUR DUTCH EMBASSY 
60	00:07:18.413	00:07:22.080	THAT ANOTHER ENVOY WOULD BE RESPECTFULLY RECEIVED. 
61	00:07:22.082	00:07:24.934	THE SITUATION IN FRANCE HAS CHANGED. 
62	00:07:24.936	00:07:27.002	GENERAL BONAPARTE HAS PROCLAIMED HIMSELF 
63	00:07:27.004	00:07:29.405	SOVEREIGN RULER AND DECLARED THE REVOLUTION OVER. 
64	00:07:31.942	00:07:34.893	FROM MONARCHY TO ANARCHY AND BACK TO MONARCHY. 
65	00:07:37.096	00:07:39.064	SO MUCH FOR THE OVERTHROW 
66	00:07:39.066	00:07:41.133	OF THE ANCIENT TYRANNIES OF EUROPE. 
67	00:07:41.135	00:07:43.852	BONAPARTE WILL HAVE LITTLE TIME FOR AMERICA. 
68	00:07:43.854	00:07:45.654	HE MUST CONSOLIDATE HIS POWER IN FRANCE, 
69	00:07:45.656	00:07:47.440	PURSUE THE WAR WITH BRITAIN. 
70	00:07:49.393	00:07:51.060	THIS IS THE VERY NEWS 
71	00:07:51.062	00:07:53.812	THAT I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR. ( laughs ) 
72	00:07:54.915	00:07:57.216	DELIVERED TO ME BY MY OWN SON 
73	00:07:57.218	00:08:00.135	FROM MY OWN SON. WELL DONE. 
74	00:08:00.137	00:08:02.188	WELL DONE, SIR. 
75	00:08:02.190	00:08:04.156	LET MR. JEFFERSON CALL YOU A WARMONGER NOW. 
76	00:08:04.158	00:08:06.809	AH. AH. 
77	00:08:06.811	00:08:08.811	( laughs ) 
78	00:08:12.015	00:08:14.567	( scrubbing ) 
79	00:08:16.403	00:08:19.088	HAS THERE BEEN ANY NEWS FROM COLONEL SMITH? 
80	00:08:19.990	00:08:21.724	NOT OF LATE. 
81	00:08:27.614	00:08:30.282	NABBY, IT IS NOT GOOD FOR THE CHILDREN... YES, MOTHER? 
82	00:08:30.284	00:08:32.251	...TO BE WITHOUT THEIR FATHER FOR SO LONG. 
83	00:08:32.253	00:08:34.670	I AM RESIGNED TO THE ABSENCES OF MY HUSBAND... 
84	00:08:36.606	00:08:38.641	AS YOU ONCE WERE. 
85	00:08:40.961	00:08:43.595	NABBY, THERE IS NOTHING I CAN DO 
86	00:08:43.597	00:08:45.497	TO ALTER WHAT HAS PASSED. 
87	00:08:46.767	00:08:49.234	SHOULD THERE BE SOMETHING I COULD DO TO CORRECT 
88	00:08:49.236	00:08:50.853	HE SHALL RETURN AS SOON AS HE IS ABLE, MOTHER. 
89	00:08:52.456	00:08:55.191	I HAVE NO REASON TO DOUBT HIS PROMISE TO ME, 
90	00:08:55.193	00:08:58.060	NOR THE AFFECTION HE FEELS FOR ME AND THE CHILDREN. 
91	00:08:59.196	00:09:00.846	AS FOR THE REST OF IT, I AM MANAGING. 
92	00:09:02.332	00:09:04.300	YOU NEED NOT WORRY. BUT I DO. 
93	00:09:08.221	00:09:10.122	HOW CAN I NOT? 
94	00:09:16.279	00:09:18.581	AT THE END OF THE SUMMER, WE RETURN TO PHILADELPHIA. 
95	00:09:20.350	00:09:22.768	PERHAPS YOU AND THE CHILDREN COULD RETURN WITH US. 
96	00:09:24.471	00:09:26.104	WE ARE FINE HERE. 
97	00:09:33.430	00:09:37.183	WE REMOVE OURSELVES TO THE NEW CAPITAL A FEW MONTHS LATER. 
98	00:09:37.185	00:09:39.035	PERHAPS THEN? 
99	00:09:40.287	00:09:41.854	FOR THE PRESIDENT'S DAUGHTER TO BE LIVING 
100	00:09:41.856	00:09:43.573	IN WASHINGTON CITY WITHOUT HER HUSBAND? 
101	00:09:45.392	00:09:47.844	I'D NEVER DO THAT, 
102	00:09:47.846	00:09:49.645	NOT TO FATHER. 
103	00:09:52.449	00:09:54.082	IT IS BEST WE REMAIN WHERE WE ARE. 
104	00:10:24.398	00:10:26.215	( people chatting ) 
105	00:10:30.937	00:10:32.722	CURRENT HOSTILITIES IN EUROPE 
106	00:10:32.724	00:10:35.224	DEMAND A FIRM AMERICAN RESPONSE, SIR. 
107	00:10:36.326	00:10:37.927	WHEN THE SCOURGE OF YELLOW FEVER 
108	00:10:37.929	00:10:39.662	IS REMOVED FROM PHILADELPHIA 
109	00:10:39.664	00:10:41.831	AND THE GOVERNMENT MAY RESUME ITS WORK, 
110	00:10:41.833	00:10:44.984	I WILL LEAVE TRENTON AND RETURN TO THE CAPITAL. 
111	00:10:44.986	00:10:48.504	I INTEND TO DELIVER A RESPONSE, MR. HAMILTON. 
112	00:10:48.506	00:10:50.506	REST ASSURED OF THAT. 
113	00:10:50.508	00:10:52.291	SHOULD VICTORY FALL TO BRITAIN, 
114	00:10:52.293	00:10:54.743	AS IT MOST SURELY MUST, 
115	00:10:54.745	00:10:59.131	THEN THE BOURBONS ARE LIKELY TO REGAIN THE THRONE OF FRANCE. 
116	00:10:59.133	00:11:01.867	ANY DEALINGS WITH A CURRENT ILLEGITIMATE GOVERNMENT THERE 
117	00:11:01.869	00:11:04.970	COULD WELL REDOUND TO OUR DETRIMENT... 
118	00:11:04.972	00:11:06.972	LEADING US BACK INTO A WAR WITH BRITAIN 
119	00:11:06.974	00:11:08.941	WE CAN ILLAFFORD TO WAGE. 
120	00:11:08.943	00:11:11.226	WHAT IF THE FRENCH... 
121	00:11:11.228	00:11:15.031	NOT THE BRITISH, EMERGE VICTORIOUS, MR. HAMILTON? 
122	00:11:15.033	00:11:17.049	THE PRETENDER BONAPARTE 
123	00:11:17.051	00:11:19.851	IS WITHIN A HAIRSBREADTH OF VICTORY OVER MOST OF EUROPE. 
124	00:11:19.853	00:11:21.454	IN THAT REGRETTABLE INSTANCE, 
125	00:11:21.456	00:11:23.055	WE MUST BE PREPARED TO TAKE POSSESSION 
126	00:11:23.057	00:11:25.090	OF VALUABLE, STRATEGIC TERRITORY 
127	00:11:25.092	00:11:26.975	BEFORE FRANCE CAN LAY HER HANDS ON IT. 
128	00:11:28.478	00:11:30.613	ALL THE TERRITORY THIS SIDE OF THE MISSISSIPPI 
129	00:11:30.615	00:11:32.181	MUST BE OURS. 
130	00:11:33.600	00:11:35.968	YOU WOULD SEIZE 
131	00:11:35.970	00:11:38.971	SPANISH FLORIDA AND LOUISIANA? AND NOT ONLY THOSE, SIR. 
132	00:11:38.973	00:11:41.607	IF UNIVERSAL EMPIRE IS TO BE THE PURSUIT OF FRANCE, 
133	00:11:41.609	00:11:43.409	WHAT CAN TEND TO DEFEAT THEIR PURPOSE BETTER 
134	00:11:43.411	00:11:46.946	THAN TO DETACH SOUTH AMERICA FROM SPAIN? 
135	00:11:46.948	00:11:50.933	IT IS THE ONLY CHANNEL THROUGH WHICH THE RICHES OF MEXICO AND PERU CONVEY TO FRANCE. 
136	00:11:50.935	00:11:54.069	LET US NOT FORGET THERE ARE THOSE IN OUR OWN COUNTRY, SIR, 
137	00:11:54.071	00:11:56.705	WHO WOULD PREFER SECESSION TO OUR CONTINUED UNION. 
138	00:11:58.491	00:12:00.442	IF THEY SHOULD BE SO BOLD AS TO ACT 
139	00:12:00.444	00:12:03.028	ON THEIR THREATS, IN THE EVENT, SAY, 
140	00:12:03.030	00:12:04.663	OF A FRENCH VICTORY, 
141	00:12:04.665	00:12:06.665	WE MUST BE PREPARED TO BRING THE RENEGADES 
142	00:12:06.667	00:12:09.101	BACK INTO THE FOLD BY FORCE IF NECESSARY. 
143	00:12:13.006	00:12:15.373	NEVER IN MY LIFE 
144	00:12:15.375	00:12:18.043	HAVE I HEARD A MAN SPEAK MORE LIKE A FOOL. 
145	00:12:19.646	00:12:21.764	SIR? 
146	00:12:21.766	00:12:24.066	YOUR ACTIONS, MR. HAMILTON, 
147	00:12:24.068	00:12:25.934	WOULD PRECIPITATE 
148	00:12:25.936	00:12:29.638	THE VERY THING THAT YOU PRETEND TO PROTECT AGAINST 
149	00:12:29.640	00:12:31.857	THE DISSOLUTION OF THIS NATION. 
150	00:12:33.593	00:12:36.695	MAY INFORM YOU AS WELL, SIR, THAT I AM IN POSSESSION 
151	00:12:36.697	00:12:38.397	OF INTELLIGENCE WHICH CONFIRMS 
152	00:12:38.399	00:12:40.366	THAT WE ARE AS LIKELY TO FIND A FRENCH ARMY 
153	00:12:40.368	00:12:42.918	ON THESE SHORES AS WE ARE ON THE MOON! 
154	00:12:44.454	00:12:47.523	YOU DREAM OF EMPIRE, MR. HAMILTON. 
155	00:12:49.126	00:12:51.843	YOU QUESTION MY LOYALTIES? OH NO, MR. HAMILTON, 
156	00:12:51.845	00:12:53.629	I QUESTION YOUR SANITY. 
157	00:12:55.582	00:12:59.385	NOW EITHER YOU ARE STARK RAVING MAD OR I AM! 
158	00:12:59.387	00:13:01.403	GOOD DAY, SIR. 
159	00:13:03.106	00:13:05.490	YOU WOULD DO WELL TO REMEMBER, SIR, 
160	00:13:05.492	00:13:07.059	HOW YOU BECAME PRESIDENT 
161	00:13:08.228	00:13:10.913	BY THREE VOTES. 
162	00:13:11.898	00:13:13.565	GOOD DAY, GENERAL. 
163	00:13:16.336	00:13:18.287	( door slams ) 
164	00:13:22.008	00:13:23.342	WHY DID YOU NOT FIRST CONSULT WITH US 
165	00:13:23.344	00:13:25.611	BEFORE REQUESTING CONGRESS DISBAND THE ARMY? 
166	00:13:26.813	00:13:29.447	WELL, YOUR ADVICE WAS NOT REQUIRED, GENTLEMEN. 
167	00:13:30.500	00:13:32.217	I DO NOT INTEND TO ENTER THE NEW CAPITAL 
168	00:13:32.219	00:13:34.403	WITH AN OCCUPYING FORCE FOLLOWING BEHIND ME. 
169	00:13:34.405	00:13:36.188	YOU WOULD NOT HAVE DARED TO DO THIS 
170	00:13:36.190	00:13:39.341	IF GENERAL WASHINGTON WERE STILL ALIVE. 
171	00:13:39.343	00:13:42.077	GENERAL WASHINGTON WAS THE RIGHTFUL LEADER OF THIS ARMY, 
172	00:13:42.079	00:13:43.746	SO I THINK THAT YOU WILL BOTH AGREE 
173	00:13:43.748	00:13:45.848	THAT HE IS... IRREPLACEABLE. 
174	00:13:48.801	00:13:52.020	WHY ON EARTH WOULD YOU DISBAND THE ARMY WHEN WE ARE PREPARING FOR WAR? 
175	00:13:52.022	00:13:53.589	WHY ON EARTH DO WE NEED AN ARMY 
176	00:13:53.591	00:13:55.257	WHEN WE ARE PREPARING FOR PEACE? 
177	00:13:55.259	00:13:57.910	YOU MUST ABANDON THIS FOLLY OF A RENEWED PEACE COMMISSION 
178	00:13:57.912	00:14:00.195	YOU MAY THINK IT FOLLY, MR. PICKERING. I DO NOT. 
179	00:14:00.197	00:14:02.931	SHOULD THE CURRENT CRISIS BE ALLOWED TO PERSIST A FEW MONTHS LONGER... 
180	00:14:04.301	00:14:07.386	OUR PARTY COULD BE ASSURED OF A FAVORABLE OUTCOME 
181	00:14:07.388	00:14:09.121	IN THE UPCOMING ELECTION. 
182	00:14:11.291	00:14:13.475	YOUR REELECTION WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN. 
183	00:14:13.477	00:14:16.645	DO NOT SPEAK TO ME OF POLITICS, MAN. 
184	00:14:16.647	00:14:19.715	THE PEOPLE ARE ANIMATED, SIR. 
185	00:14:19.717	00:14:22.084	REMOVE THE FRENCH THREAT AND THEY'RE LIKELY TO DESERT US. 
186	00:14:22.086	00:14:25.420	GOVERNMENT BY FEAR IS NO GOVERNMENT AT ALL, MR. MCHENRY. 
187	00:14:26.839	00:14:29.507	YOUR INTRANSIGENCE MY INTRANSIGENCE? 
188	00:14:29.509	00:14:31.793	YOUR STUBBORNNESS WILL BE OUR RUIN. 
189	00:14:31.795	00:14:33.429	YOU WOULD SURRENDER OUR PARTY'S INTERESTS 
190	00:14:33.431	00:14:36.365	TO THOSE OF MR. JEFFERSON AND HIS SOCALLED REPUBLICANS. 
191	00:14:38.235	00:14:41.203	AND YOU, SIRS, ARE SUBSERVIENT TO HAMILTON...

319	00:27:57.251	00:28:01.235	AND NOW HE SEEKS TO DO THE SAME TO ME, MR. SECRETARY.
320	00:28:07.759	00:28:10.978	IS THERE STILL NO WORD FROM PARIS, MR. MARSHALL?

602	01:04:12.472	01:04:14.922	THE CANCER WILL LIKELY NOT RETURN,
603	01:04:14.924	01:04:18.276	TO TROUBLE HER. CAN YOU BE CERTAIN?,

666	01:08:15.299	01:08:17.499	AND IN OTHERS, I AM IRRELEVANT.
667	01:08:17.501	01:08:20.485	JOHN, I DO NOT THINK
668	01:08:20.487	01:08:23.554	THAT ANYONE THINKS ABOUT US ONE WAY OR T'OTHER.

674	01:08:54.904	01:08:58.273	( chuckles ) HOPELESS.
675	01:08:59.942	01:09:02.911	NO NO, THE ESSENCE OF OUR REVOLUTION
676	01:09:02.913	01:09:06.964	WILL BE THAT DR. FRANKLIN SMOTE THE EARTH,
677	01:09:06.966	01:09:08.900	WITH HIS ELECTRICAL ROD,
678	01:09:08.902	01:09:11.569	AND OUT SPRANG WASHINGTON AND JEFFERSON,
679	01:09:11.571	01:09:14.305	THAT THEY TOGETHER,
680	01:09:14.307	01:09:17.409	CONDUCTED ALL THE POLICY NEGOTIATION,

685	01:09:35.060	01:09:38.229	AT LEAST HE IS NOT THE REVOLUTIONARY WE FORGET.

687	01:09:40.133	01:09:42.967	BY BROKERING A DEAL WITH NAPOLEON, HUH?
688	01:09:46.522	01:09:49.590	I DO NOT NEED TO JUSTIFY MYSELF ON PAPER.
689	01:09:49.592	01:09:51.592	BESIDES, POSTERITY WILL JUDGE
690	01:09:51.594	01:09:53.862	AS SHE SEES FIT.

775	01:21:36.848	01:21:39.533	I DID NOT MEAN TO GO ON SO. 
776	01:21:39.535	01:21:41.969	MY OWN SADNESS 
777	01:21:41.971	01:21:44.087	HAS NOT DIMINISHED THE JOY I TAKE

889	01:31:52.130	01:31:54.731	NOR RIVALRY OR PARTY.

898	01:32:29.150	01:32:31.117	WHAT YOU HAVE SUFFERED, ARE SUFFERING
899	01:32:31.119	01:32:33.186	AND HAVE YET TO ENDURE.
900	01:32:33.188	01:32:35.155	THESE SAME TRIALS HAVE TAUGHT ME,
901	01:32:35.157	01:32:38.141	THAT FOR ILLS SO IMMEASURABLE,
902	01:32:38.143	01:32:40.827	TIME AND SILENCE ARE THE ONLY MEDICINES.
903	01:32:42.296	01:32:44.331	IT IS OF SOME COMFORT TO US BOTH,
904	01:32:44.333	01:32:46.433	THAT THE TERM IS NOT VERY DISTANT,
905	01:32:46.435	01:32:49.202	AT WHICH WE ARE TO DEPOSIT OUR SORROWS,
906	01:32:49.204	01:32:51.604	AND SUFFERING BODIES,
907	01:32:51.606	01:32:55.742	AND TO ASCEND TO AN ECSTATIC MEETING,
908	01:32:55.744	01:32:57.877	WITH THE FRIENDS WE HAVE LOVED AND LOST...
909	01:32:59.313	01:33:01.347	AND WHOM WE SHALL STILL LOVE,

914	01:33:21.202	01:33:22.769	AND WE HAVE SUFFERED OURSELVES,
915	01:33:22.771	01:33:26.123	TO BE THE PASSIVE SUBJECTS OF PUBLIC DISCUSSION,
916	01:33:26.125	01:33:28.307	AND REAPED ANIMOSITY AND BITTERNESS.
917	01:33:29.994	01:33:31.794	I AM FIXED IN MY OPINIONS,
918	01:33:31.796	01:33:34.697	AND TOO OLD TO CHANGE THEM,
919	01:33:34.699	01:33:36.616	BUT YOU AND I OUGHT NOT TO DIE,
920	01:33:36.618	01:33:39.385	BEFORE WE HAVE EXPLAINED OURSELVES TO EACH OTHER.

922	01:33:41.990	01:33:43.990	THERE WILL BE DIFFERENCES OF OPINION.
923	01:33:43.992	01:33:46.660	EVERYONE TAKES A SIDE,
924	01:33:46.662	01:33:49.646	IN FAVOR OF THE MANY OR THE FEW.
925	01:33:49.648	01:33:52.349	NOTHING NEW COULD BE ADDED BY YOU OR ME,
926	01:33:52.351	01:33:54.117	TO WHAT HAS BEEN SAID BY OTHERS,
927	01:33:54.119	01:33:55.835	AND WILL BE SAID IN EVERY AGE.

1035	01:39:44.836	01:39:48.204	THAT ONE OF THE GREATEST TALENTS OF A PAINTER,
1036	01:39:48.206	01:39:52.274	IS THE CAPABILITY TO COMPREHEND A LARGE SPACE.
1037	01:39:52.276	01:39:54.744	HERR RUBENS, WHOSE CANVASES
1038	01:39:54.746	01:39:56.563	I ALWAYS PAUSED TO ADMIRE,
1039	01:39:56.565	01:39:59.582	WHEN I WAS STAYING IN HOLLAND, WAS A MASTER OF THIS.
1040	01:39:59.584	01:40:02.034	YOU, MR. TRUMBULL, ,

1047	01:40:19.087	01:40:20.619	I CAN OFFER NO OPINION.
1048	01:40:22.589	01:40:24.406	BUT I WILL SAY THIS,
1049	01:40:26.510	01:40:28.727	IT IS VERY BAD HISTORY.
1050	01:40:31.015	01:40:33.083	THE LIKENESSES HAVE BEEN VERY CAREFULLY RESEARCHED,
1051	01:40:33.085	01:40:35.451	NO SCENE SUCH AS YOU DEPICT HERE,
1052	01:40:35.453	01:40:37.053	EVER TOOK PLACE.
1053	01:40:37.055	01:40:39.455	THERE WAS NOT ONE MOMENT OR ONE DAY,
1054	01:40:39.457	01:40:41.557	WHEN ALL THE DELEGATES FROM THE CONGRESS GATHERED,
1055	01:40:41.559	01:40:43.693	TO RECORD THEIR SIGNATURES.
1056	01:40:43.695	01:40:45.912	THIS IS A MATTER OF DETAIL.
1057	01:40:45.914	01:40:48.114	MAY I REMIND YOU, SIR, ,
1058	01:40:48.116	01:40:51.166	THAT WE WERE ALREADY AT WAR?,

1064	01:41:05.483	01:41:09.852	YOU WOULD NOT DENY THE ARTIST A CERTAIN... LICENSE?,
1065	01:41:09.854	01:41:12.121	DO NOT LET OUR POSTERITY,
1066	01:41:12.123	01:41:15.425	BE DELUDED WITH FICTIONS,
1067	01:41:15.427	01:41:17.026	UNDER THE GUISE OF POETICAL,
1068	01:41:17.028	01:41:19.194	OR GRAPHICAL LICENSE.
1069	01:41:19.196	01:41:22.265	IT IS A VERY COMMON OBSERVATION,
1070	01:41:22.267	01:41:24.167	IN EUROPE, MR. TRUMBULL, ,
1071	01:41:24.169	01:41:25.935	THAT NOTHING IS SO FALSE,
1072	01:41:25.937	01:41:27.870	AS MODERN HISTORY.
1073	01:41:27.872	01:41:30.956	WELL, I WOULD HASTEN TO ADD
1074	01:41:30.958	01:41:33.709	THAT NOTHING IS SO FALSE AS MODERN EUROPEAN HISTORY,
1075	01:41:33.711	01:41:36.396	EXCEPT MODERN AMERICAN HISTORY.
1076	01:41:38.465	01:41:41.017	IN PLAIN ENGLISH, SIR, ,
1077	01:41:43.303	01:41:46.022	I CONSIDER THE TRUE HISTORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION...
1078	01:41:49.360	01:41:51.194	AS LOST...
1079	01:41:58.101	01:41:59.536	FOREVER.
1080	01:42:25.061	01:42:27.797	I HAVE SOME SCRUPLES OF CONSCIENCE ABOUT...
1081	01:42:29.683	01:42:31.250	WHETHER I OUGHT TO BE PRESERVED,
1082	01:42:31.252	01:42:34.219	OR WHETHER IT WOULD BE CHARITY OF ME TO STUMBLE.
1083	01:42:36.606	01:42:38.107	STILL,
1084	01:42:38.109	01:42:41.744	STILL, I AM NOT WEARY OF LIFE.
1085	01:42:43.330	01:42:44.947	STRANGELY,
1086	01:42:44.949	01:42:46.615	I HAVE HOPE.

1089	01:42:52.891	01:42:54.390	HMM?,
1090	01:42:54.392	01:42:56.359	IT'S GETTING LATE, FATHER.
1091	01:42:56.361	01:42:58.027	IS IT?,
1092	01:42:59.413	01:43:00.947	LET'S GO INSIDE.
1093	01:43:03.416	01:43:05.367	COME HERE, COME HERE.
1094	01:43:08.689	01:43:11.674	I HAVE SEEN A QUEEN OF FRANCE,
1095	01:43:11.676	01:43:15.060	WITH 18 MILLION LIVRES OF DIAMONDS ON HER PERSON.
1096	01:43:17.264	01:43:19.732	BUT I DECLARE,
1097	01:43:19.734	01:43:22.067	THAT ALL THE CHARMS OF HER FACE AND FIGURE,
1098	01:43:22.069	01:43:24.304	ADDED TO ALL THE GLITTER OF HER JEWELS,
1099	01:43:24.306	01:43:26.972	DID NOT IMPRESS ME AS MUCH,
1100	01:43:26.974	01:43:29.208	AS THAT LITTLE SHRUB...
1101	01:43:30.927	01:43:33.312	RIGHT THERE.
1102	01:43:33.314	01:43:34.947	NOW YOUR MOTHER ALWAYS SAID,
1103	01:43:34.949	01:43:36.682	THAT I NEVER DELIGHTED ENOUGH,
1104	01:43:36.684	01:43:38.517	IN THE MUNDANE.
1105	01:43:40.570	01:43:44.206	BUT NOW I FIND IF I LOOK AT EVEN THE SMALLEST THING...
1106	01:43:49.479	01:43:52.514	MY IMAGINATION BEGINS TO ROAM THE MILKY WAY.
1107	01:44:03.610	01:44:05.511	REJOICE EVERMORE.
