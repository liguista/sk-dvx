Under the support of a three-year grant from the National Eye Institute (NEI grant #[R01](https://code.google.com/p/sk-dvx/source/detail?r=01) EY020925-01), Smith-Kettlewell is currently conducting an exciting new project to investigate the use of crowd-sourcing to provide readily available amateur description for DVD-based video.

The DVX Project is developing software that allows sighted video viewers to seamlessly add audio description to DVDs as they watch. Those descriptions are then automatically shared over the Internet while the video materials remain only on the DVD.

The DVX project is evaluating: 1) the effectiveness of crowd-sourced audio description, 2) the effectiveness of automated digital tools for enhancing the presentation of amateur audio description, and 3) the effectiveness of using social networks and online communities for the recruitment of volunteer audio describers.
